## Stakeholder 2 Interview Response
**1. What is your current occupation or primary role? Can you describe what you do?**

I'm the front desk lead receptionist for the pediatrician floor. Oversee staff on the floor. Check in patients, verify patients insurance, schedule appointments, call patients for rescheduling, new patient registration


**2. Does your role involve using any specific tools, websites, or applications? If so, which ones?**

It requires me to use different insurance websites, EPIC (scheduling patient appointments), excel sheet, outlook

**3. How do you typically use these tools, websites, or applications in your work?**

- **Different Insurance Websites:** eligibility of patients’ insurance 
- **EPIC:** patient registration, scheduling, medical record (information of past visits), collect payment from patients 
- **Excel Sheet:** to make coworker’s working schedule 
- **Outlook:** emails from company and scheduling meetings with coworkers/boss

**4. How would you describe your experience using these tools or platforms? (e.g., easy, challenging, intuitive, time-consuming)**

In the beginning it was difficult to navigate, but once I got used to it, it was easy to use. It was hard to learn about the different function keys and how to navigate around the application. 

**5. Are there parts of your workday where you face frustrations or repetition using certain tools/tech? Why?**

Something frustrating about using EPIC is that when someone else is viewing a patient file and I need to also view it, the file is locked and it says someone else is viewing the file. Patients file can not be viewed at the same time. However there is a request access button which notifies the person viewing the file that someone else needs to view the file. 

It becomes repetitive when I need to ask frequent patients to answer the same pre-check in questions before the appointment. 


Outlook is helpful to keep track of all my meetings. Very easy to communicate with my coworkers and my boss. 


Schedules on the excel sheet need to be manually updated when scheduling changes occur. My coworkers will need to message or call me privately to inform me about any schedule changes and I will need to update the schedule on excel. 


**6. If you could improve or change anything about these tools or platforms, what would it be, and how do you think it would enhance your experience?**

When I am setting my availability on the Excel sheet, it is frustrating that I would need to do it individually for each day. For example, if I wanted to say I am taking PTO for 2 weeks, I would need to individually enter in “pto” for each day I am unavailable.  

**7. Have you encountered any accessibility issues or challenges while using these tools or platforms? If so, please elaborate.**

No, I don't encounter any accessibility issues using these tools.

**8. Do you feel that these tools meet your professional needs effectively? Why or why not?**

Yes because it’s very to organize patients information/scheduling

**9. If you had the opportunity to design a new tool or platform for your work, what key features or functionalities would you include?**

I like that EPIC provides a lot of different methods to complete a task. For example, there are many different methods to schedule patient appointments. It's very convenient and saves time. 

I think it’s helpful that there is a button to ask for access to a patients’ file when someone is currently viewing it. Something I would change would be to provide an auditory feature so people will be more aware of when I need access to the file that they are currently viewing.


**10. How do you usually learn to use new tools or platforms for work? Do you rely on training, documentation, or experimentation?**

First there is a meeting time for group training from the EPIC team via Zoom
    
Ask the company’s Electronic Health Record team for any help/confusion I have 

**11. Can you walk us through a task that you often perform in a typical workday? (process of uploading an imaging/x-ray result)**


**Check-In:**
    
1. Open Epic
2. Input medical record number or name & birthday 
3. Search for the patient's record in the system
4. See if they have an appointment or not
5. If they have an appointment, we will double check all the patient’s information (address, birthday, emergency contact number)
6. If everything is correct, we will press the “check in” button
7. The back office (nursing) will be notified that they have arrived

<br>

**Check-Out:**
1. After they are done with the appointment and do not need to schedule a new appointment, I will press “check out” button
2. If they need a new appointment, there are 2 methods to scheduling an appointment
    a. Patients will receive an appointment card given by the doctor and the card is given to me and I will schedule the appointment.
    b. Doctor sends a message to the front desk, informing me about the next appointment time 
3. On EPIC, it will inform me if I need to collect insurance copayment from the patient 
4. Then I will press the “check out” button
