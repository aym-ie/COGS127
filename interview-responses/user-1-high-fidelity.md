## Feedback from user 1:
**Overall:**
- I like that although each screen has a lot of information on it, it is still very easy to follow along. The labeled buttons are straightforward and I don’t have to guess what each button will lead me to. Something I’m curious about is how it would look when the user scrolls on the page. I hope users can still easily navigate throughout the system when they are scrolled down a page. Something else I would like to have is different view options. I personally prefer to view my files in grid mode. On the first page, I was a little confused about what the list icon will do because there isn’t any indicator that there is a different view option.

**Original vs. Alternative 1:**
- I prefer the alternative screen because I like that the inbox is easy to find in the top right corner. It allows me to preview the messages so I can check if the unread message is what I am looking for without switching to a new page. I think the original screen makes it a little hard to quickly find the inbox and it took me a second to see where the inbox is.

**Original vs. Alternative 2:**
- For the alternative screen, I like how I can press on the folder before clicking the “move” button. It feels like I have more freedom to click different folders before confirming on which folder to move it in. I think it would be nice to combine both screens and give users the option for both list and grid mode so they can decide which best suits them.
