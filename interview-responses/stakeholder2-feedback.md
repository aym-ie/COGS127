## Stakeholder 2 User Testing Response

**1. For task 1: Does the check-in process for the patient satisfy the requirements for a typical check-in?**

Yes, because it is very straightforward. All I have to do is login and answer a few questions and I’m all checked in.

**2. For task 2: Does this flow efficiently update a patient’s medical record?**

Yes because I was able to successfully click through the whole process and reach the intended result. 

**3. What about this prototype stands out to you?**

- **(TASK 1)** I really like the view button because it stands out and doesn’t blend into the patient information, so it’s noticeable, which makes it easy for the user to access without having to click through a bunch of things
- **(TASK 2)** I feel like each step is very critical to updating the record; there aren’t any unnecessary steps that would create more confusion or anything. I was able to send messages directly and I didn't have to do a separate email to contact the x-ray company; I was able to contact them directly through the same page.

**4. Is there anything you liked or disliked?**

- **(TASK 1)** I like how it’s simple and straightforward, and there wasn’t any useless information. I don’t really like how the patient info and doctor info card style is so similar. I feel like the only thing that is different is the name and profile picture which would confuse people and I want to differentiate myself from the doctor.
- **(TASK 2)** I would like the final prototype to indicate that categories in the medical record were clickable because I wasn’t sure that I could press into the spine x-ray

**5. Was there anything you particularly struggled with?**

- **(TASK 1)** No
- **(TASK 2)** No

**6. Were there any features you were confused or unclear about?**

- **(TASK 1)** Is this a patient portal or is this for checking in? Can they view their past visits, present visits, make an appointment, or is this only where they check in?
- **(TASK 2)** What if they have the same name and same age? I feel like you should include a patient's medical record or a profile picture.

**7. Do you see any issues that would arise from this prototype?**

- **(TASK 1)** If the patient information is displayed in the main page, why does it need to be displayed again when I press into the appointment information. It seems redundant to display the same information again on multiple screens.
- **(TASK 2)** I think viewing the messages when they pop up would be an issue. I feel like there should be an inbox where we could view the messages.

#### After Both Flows
**1. Which flow did you find more intuitive and why?**

I thought that the first flow was more intuitive because the second one has some things where I wouldn’t think to press on at first sight. For example, the names and email icon, I wouldn’t know that those were buttons.

**2. How do these prototypes compare to your current workflow?**

I would say that the first workflow would save a lot of time on my end because I would usually have to input all the information myself. This saves time for me and other patients because they can input the information themselves.
