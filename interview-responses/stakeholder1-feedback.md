## Stakeholder 1 User Testing Response

**1. For task 1: Does the check-in process for the patient satisfy the requirements for a typical check-in?**

Yes, if all required check-in questions are given to the patient to be answered.


**2. For task 2: Does this flow efficiently update a patient’s medical record?**

Yes, if we had this type of flow in the clinic that I work in my life would be so much easier. However there are many things that can cause this type of flow to be impossible. For example in our clinic we must upload DICOM files and not only PDFs. These file types are harder to work with than PDFs and I don’t think they can be emailed.


**3. What about this prototype stands out to you?**

- **(TASK 1)** Where will this device/prototype be located? Where will the patient interact with something like this? Will it be in the waiting room on an iPad? How will they log in and how will it ensure that a patient’s information is not accidentally shown to the incorrect patient (causing a HIPAA violation)?

- **(TASK 2)** I think this prototype would make for a very efficient office, especially in a surgical clinic where x-rays are essential for work. A lot of clinics have their own x-rays if a lot of x-rays are needed, but in the clinic I work in, many of the patients go to different imaging facilities. If there was a way to obtain imaging from each facility through one interface that would be miraculous.

**4. Is there anything you liked or disliked?**

- **(TASK 1)** It seemed very bare but that is good because it makes it easy and clear to the patients what they need to do to check in. Maybe on the first page there could be a check-in checklist to ensure that everything is taken care of if there are more things required than just the questionnaire (i.e. insurance information, address, preferred pharmacy, etc.)

- **(TASK 2)** I liked being able to access everything from one interface. One struggle I have in my clinic is that I have to go to many different websites and imaging facility portals in order to get the imaging for our patients.

**5. Was there anything you particularly struggled with?**

- **(TASK 1)** Not really I was just clicking buttons.

- **(TASK 2)** With this prototype, no. I’m not sure how feasible it is, but if something like this could be created that would be amazing.

**6. Were there any features you were confused or unclear about?**

- **(TASK 1)** Not really, the features seem pretty clear.

- **(TASK 2)** How does the email system work? Is it integrated in the electronic medical records (EMR) system? Can we only obtain PDFs of the imaging report from the companies through this system? PDFs do not allow providers to see the actual x-rays, only what the radiologist says about the x-rays.

**7. Do you see any issues that would arise from this prototype?**

- **(TASK 1)** Not from what I went through initially.

- **(TASK 2)** [see above]

#### After Both Flows
**1. Which flow did you find more intuitive and why?**

Both were easy to navigate so they were equally intuitive I suppose.

**2. How do these prototypes compare to your current workflow?**

I can only compare the second one, which is much better than my current workflow. Ease of access to imaging files, but this also puts the burden on human-human communication which can make the process slower.
