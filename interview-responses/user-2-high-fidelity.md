## Feedback from user 2:
**Overall:**
- I love how formal the website looks and feels when I use it. I’m not sure if it is scrollable, but I wish it was so I can actually use the prototype like an actual website and gain an understanding of how the site might actually function. As I went through each page, I was able to easily identify buttons, but I did wish it was more button-like—so maybe 3D or has a drop shadow to signify that I can press on it. I wonder what would happen if I made a mistake and submitted the photo to the wrong file. How would the user take it out of the file if they made a mistake?

**Original vs. Alternative 1:**
- I think I prefer the alternative version a lot better. It seems more intuitive and obvious to me, which makes navigating the website a lot easier. I think having an inbox on the right hand corner of the site is more noticeable, rather than having the notification pop up where there are already a bunch of buttons in the original page.

**Original vs. Alternative 2:**
- I also like the alternative of the files or patient documents where it is a grid rather than a list. It seems more readable and easy to find.
