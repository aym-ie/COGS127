# COGS 127 Case Study

Alice Ma, Kelly La, Jessica Ouyang, Amy Yee

## Background
In a medical setting, the medical receptionists are the first point of contact for patients in person and over the phone. In general, they are responsible for organizing the medical office's operations. 

Our two stakeholders, both medical receptionists, ensure the smooth running of the medical office by communicating with clients/patients, managing schedules, making appointments, addressing patient inquiries, and more.

In a typical workday, medical receptionists rely on multiple digital tools to streamline workflow. However, inefficiencies in these systems often lead to frustration and delays in patient care. By exploring their experiences and challenges, this project aims to identify opportunities to improve workflow efficiency and enhance the overall patient care experience.

## User Research Method
We are conducting **two stakeholder interviews**. We conducted the first interview before Milestone 1 and conducted the second interview before Milestone 2.

**Stakeholder 1:** The person I have contacted is the head intern of the research department. He leads interns in the research department, organizing shifts, coordinating tasks, and training interns. He also does work with papers that his department is working on as well as a large project that the clinic is involved in.

**Stakeholder 2:** The person I have contacted for this project is someone working at NEMS front desk in San Francisco. She has been working there for around 30 years. She works front desk on the pediatrician floor and is responsible for taking calls, making appointments, and organizing schedules for her co-workers.


### Pre-Interview and Set-Up Questions
We met up with our stakeholders in person and conducted an interview for 1-1.5 hours. To start off our interview, we told the stakeholders that the goal of the interview was to learn more about how they interact with applications at work, in hopes of gaining insight about challenges/frustrations that they face. We also made sure to inform them that being a stakeholder involved providing feedback and testing for future milestones.

**Photograph consent:** We will not be asking to take photos/videos due to the information being confidential to protect the patient's privacy and security.

**Audio consent:** Additionally, do we have your permission to record audio of your interview responses for us to analyze later?
