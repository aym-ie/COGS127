# COGS 127 Case Study

Alice Ma, Kelly La, Jessica Ouyang, Amy Yee

## Background
In a medical setting, the medical receptionists are the first point of contact for patients in person and over the phone. In general, they are responsible for organizing the medical office's operations. 

Our two stakeholders, both medical receptionists, ensure the smooth running of the medical office by communicating with clients/patients, managing schedules, making appointments, addressing patient inquiries, and more.

In a typical workday, medical receptionists rely on multiple digital tools to streamline workflow. However, inefficiencies in these systems often lead to frustration and delays in patient care. By exploring their experiences and challenges, this project aims to identify opportunities to improve workflow efficiency and enhance the overall patient care experience.

## User Research Method
We are conducting **two stakeholder interviews**. We conducted the first interview before Milestone 1 and conducted the second interview before Milestone 2.

**Stakeholder 1:** The person I have contacted is the head intern of the research department. He leads interns in the research department, organizing shifts, coordinating tasks, and training interns. He also does work with papers that his department is working on as well as a large project that the clinic is involved in.

**Stakeholder 2:** The person I have contacted for this project is someone working at NEMS front desk in San Francisco. She has been working there for around 30 years. She works front desk on the pediatrician floor and is responsible for taking calls, making appointments, and organizing schedules for her co-workers.

#### Pre-Interview and Set-Up Questions
We met up with our stakeholders in person and conducted an interview for 1-1.5 hours. To start off our interview, we told the stakeholders that the goal of the interview was to learn more about how they interact with applications at work, in hopes of gaining insight about challenges/frustrations that they face. We also made sure to inform them that being a stakeholder involved providing feedback and testing for future milestones.

**Photograph consent:** We will not be asking to take photos/videos due to the information being confidential to protect the patient's privacy and security.

**Audio consent:** Additionally, do we have your permission to record audio of your interview responses for us to analyze later?

### User Research Findings
#### Stakeholder 1
**Pain Points**
- eCW is frustrating; software seems old, and can only interact with one window at a time; requires too many clicks to complete simple navigation
- To go back to a previous window, eCW requires you to exit out, which could cause a break in workflow and information loss
- Cannot cross-reference different windows (violating “recognition rather than recall”)

**Wishes and Desires**
- Stakeholder 1 wishes that eCW has a more efficient “order of things”

**Opportunities/Gaps**
- Explore electronic medical record systems and identify how to enhance user workflow

<br>

#### Stakeholder 2
**Pain Points**
- EPIC restricts 2 people from viewing the same patient file, resulting in delayed patient care. 
- Schedules and availability on Excel Sheet need to be manually updated for each day
- Frustrated with repetitive actions
- Need to keep track with last minute schedule changed manually
- Stakeholder needs to ask patient the same pre check-in questions every time they come in (even if the patient is visiting frequently), which feels repetitive for the stakeholder 


**Wishes and Desires**
- Stakeholder 2 wishes there was an auditory way to notify others when someone wants to view the file they are on

**Opportunities/Gaps**
- Explore electronic medical record systems and identify how to reduce restrictions to create a more efficient user workflow

## Problem Statement
Through our stakeholder interviews, we found that medical administrators in clinics struggled with record management systems that lack automation and required switching between multiple programs to complete a task. As a result, our stakeholders experienced frustration with having to swap between multiple windows, causing delays in updating critical records.
